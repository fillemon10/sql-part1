In the ER-diagram: why is there an arrow in the prerequisite relation? can a course only have one prerequisite, and/or can a course only be a prerequisite for one other course?

In the ER-schema there are a few problems:

    One table is missing,
    the Branches table is missing an attribute; as a consequence the primary key is wrong: are branch names unique?
    Following the problem with Branches: RecommendedBranch & MandatoryBranch are wrong; they are missing an attribute, and both the primary key and the foreign key constraints are wrong
    For the same reason, the StudentBranches is missing an attribute and the foreign key is wrong.

The FDs and the BCNF are correct, but the MVDs and 4NF are not: you shouldn't find MVDs in (and apply the relative normalization algorithm to) the original domain, but to the schema in BCNF obtained from the FDs.
